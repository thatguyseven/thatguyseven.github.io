My name is Aaron Ni. 

I am a rising junior attending Norfolk State University and I am studying Computer Science. 

I am writing this blog to detail my experiences during this training camp for the OSRE program. This blog will probably contain my thoughts about the program and what I am currently doing during the camp. I'm probably going to update this blog at least once every three days.
