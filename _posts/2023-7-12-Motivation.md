title: An Issue to be Motivated For
---
An issue I would like to contribute to sometime in my life is an open source anti-malware software. I believe that, with the world being as reliant on the internet as it is today, being able to rest assured that my data is safe and is protected while I use my devices should be a necessity, not a commodity. If I ever become successful, the first person I would tell would definitely be my mom. There are a lot of open source projects relating towards cybersecurity, so much so that it's a bit overwhelming to see all these projects and exploring their forums and GitHubs. Though I am tempted to try to contribute, contributing would probably take a whole month learning everything needed to start contributing. Some of the forums I found, like the one for OPNSense, seemed active and supportive.
