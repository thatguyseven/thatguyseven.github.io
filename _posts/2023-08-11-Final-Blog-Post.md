title: So This Is Goodbye...For Now.
---
Eight weeks ago, I made it a goal to become better at communication and I feel that I was successful in implementing non-violent communication into my interactions(NVC) with the community. It was not a resounding success, but I feel that I am comfortable with NVC now and am able to include it in my communication normally. Having many opportunities to interact with the community certainly helped a lot in getting better with NVC communication. The next steps to take would be to become more involved in the p5.js community and become an active member if I wanted to. However, I don't think that p5.js is interesting enough to me to devote too much extra time to become more involved in. 

Here's what I've done on the p5.js project:
 - Minor typos in the documentation
 - Clarified a section of the contributing_documentation.md file
 - Suggested a possible change to the template formats (rearranging the templates or adding a new template)
 - Helped test the line endings in Silas' issue
 - Helped Onexi modify the search bar on the main website 

The most challenging issue that I worked on was definitely helping Onexi with his issue. It was a challenge to understand how the text was being rendered from the yaml files on the GitHub page into a webpage. It was also the most rewarding task I worked on, if only for the reason that it was relieving to figure out an issue that was plaguing a member of our group for the better part of our last two weeks. As an aside, that was the longest session that I had spent focused on my screen during this program so at least part of the relief was most likely both a mental reprieve and a reprieve for my eyes that were slightly burning in my sockets once we were done.

For me, one of the most valuable things that I learned over this summer was the realization that I'm not doing this alone. It feels completely obvious with how much collaboration happens on a daily basis and the very topic of this program is rooted in collaboration; yet it is something that has to be hammered into me time and time again. During this course, I was often caught up in the thinking about what I bring to the table rather than how I contribute to the group. It may seem like a small difference, but it is significant to me. I needed to stop thinking of myself as an individual on a team to a member of a group who brings his own perspectives and abilities to better the group as a whole.

Not only has this program prepared me to contribute to other open source projects, I also feel that it has given me an understanding of how it feels like to be on a team of developers. This experience has taught me so much that I can't even begin talk about everything I have learned. I would be happy to be engaged in further bettering this program so that others can benefit from all of the lessons that this program can teach them. This feels kind of surreal to realize that it has been eight weeks since we started this program, but I wish my cohort luck during their fall semester and luck to our coordinator Emily with her next cohort.

To Emily and other coordinators of OSRE Catalyst, I be happy to help in future opportunities to improve the Catalyst experience so feel free to contact me. I will help to the best of my ability.
