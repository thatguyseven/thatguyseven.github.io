title: P5.js Review
---
The purpose of P5.js is to make coding more accessible to everyone. This project is relatively large with over 500 contributors who have contributed to this project. Currently, it is only a bit more active than the OpenSSF Scorecard community I posted about two days ago. My first steps into this project would be to try out their project to get a feel for it and understand what it is trying to do. Afterwards, I would then get in contact with the community by trying to find a forum or, if there is no forum to be found, contact the developers to see how I can contribute. To help orient new contributors, there are many documents available in the contributor_docs folder with many documentation on how to format pull requests, report issues, write documentation, and other community specific information. Bugs and features are tracked by 4 categorized issue tabs, with quite a few open items on each page. However, there is barely a single issue that has not been addressed in one way or another.  If I were to give an estimate how long it would take to install, it would probably take around 15-20 minutes if you have JavaScript already installed. It would probably take an additional 10-15 minutes to download JavaScript. In total, downloading this project can range from anywhere between 15-35 minutes. To start getting involved with the community, there is a forum located in their README.md file, which seems to be their main mode of communication. Other methods of communication would be the use of discussions on GitHub, issue tabs, and messaging team leaders directly. The most interesting thing is that there is no other form of community communication other than that form, at least to my knowledge. You would think that they would have a Slack community or use some other communication app that is publicly available. This project is far bigger than the OpenSSF Scorecard project that I posted about before and it shows. First off, there are far more files and far more in-depth documentation for it. Their communication is far slower because they don’t have any obvious communication app. P5.js is also more volunteer-based than OpenSSF Scorecard since they expect community members to communicate remotely and don’t have any obvious community calls.
