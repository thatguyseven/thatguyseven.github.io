title: Some Introductions
---

Good morning, afternoon, or evening to anyone reading this post. My name is Aaron Ni and here is a little bit of information about me.

Q: Who am I?
A: I am a rising junior at [Norfolk State University](https://www.nsu.edu/) studying Computer Science. I am a Chinese-American who was raised in Hampton, Virginia. I come from a family of four: a father, a mother, myself, and a younger brother. I am the first in my family to go to college and so I have a lot to learn.

Q: What are my interests?
A: One of my hobbies are video games, especially single-player games and difficult challenges. 

Q: Do you have any prior experience with open source? If so, what is it? (It's okay if you don't have any at all!)
A: No, I don't have any open source experience. In fact, this summer program is my first foray into the world of open source software. I had heard of open source before through an ADMI Code Camp last winter, though I did not act on my curiosity until now. It is my first time doing anything related to open source development so I am unsure what I can bring to the table, but I am eager to try my best to contribute something.

Q: What do you think is the strongest skill or characteristic that you can bring to your team this summer?
A: The best thing I can offer at the moment is transparency. I am not sure what kind of project I want to work on yet, however, I will give my best effort to solve whatever issues I decide to work on and document whatever I had made progress on. I have some experience in documenting my work so I have some confidence in keeping my work as transparent as possible.

Q: What skill or characteristic would you most like to improve upon? What can you do this summer to help in that endeavor?
A: The characteristic I want to improve on is my communication skills. I realize that I am not skilled at talking, or even being concise in my speech, so the thing I most want to improve during this summer is knowing how much to speak and to learn social cues. I also have a difficult time understanding when it is appropriate to talk or say something so that is also something that I want to work on. To that end, I intend to communicate with the community I will be working with as often as I can and observe interactions in the community to learn from them.
